MotorCell â€“ a tiny, thin, high-speed PCB motor with an onboard sensorless controller. This provides direct speed feedback, eliminating the need for extra sensors. The MotorCell can be powered directly or controlled via PWM for precise speed control.

This compact motor can spin up to 30,000 RPM at no-load, making it perfect for high-speed, low-torque applications like fans, robotics, DIY crafts, and art projects.
